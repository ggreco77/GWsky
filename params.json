{"name":"Gwsky","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThe interactive script GWsky (v2) defines a sequence of Fields of View (FoV) centers from a fixed position over the sky. North/South/East/West directions are allowed. The results are displayed in Aladin Sky Atlas (http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/) using the |SAMPIntegratedClient| class. The airmass at the FoV center and the integrated probability (%) are provided during the FoV sequence.\r\n\r\nThe FoV sequence is generated along the coordinate grid; no roll angle is provided in this  release.\r\nThe FoV centers were evenly space assuming that the shortest angular distance between two points on the celestial sphere is measured along a great circle that passes through both of them:\r\n\r\n                            cosθ=sinδ1sinδ2+cosδ1cosδ2cos(α1−α2), \r\nwhere (α1,δ1) and (α2,δ2) are the right ascension and declination of the two points on the sky (expressed in degrees, then converted to radians).\r\n\r\nThe Fig. below shows a FoV sequence that covers a skymap region in which 50% of probability is contains (red dots).\r\n\r\n![gwsky_fov](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11920251/11462523/da085a7a-9715-11e5-959a-5a89076b1e1e.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
